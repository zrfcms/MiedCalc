Miedema Calculator is a thermodynamic software for predicting formation enthalpies of various alloys within framework of Miedema’s Theory. Several user-friendly interfaces are designed for the following major functional modules, i.e. the formation enthalpies of binary intermetallic compounds based on the original Miedema’s model and two more improved ones, the chemical, elastic and structural enthalpies of solid solutions, the formation enthalpies of amorphous alloys, the volume corrections upon alloying, and the formation enthalpies of ternary alloys based on various geometrical models.

Miedema Calculator is a user-interface program, which is designed and organized by the research group of Prof. R. F. Zhang et al. at Beihang University, for calculating the formation enthalpy (energy) of alloy based on the Miedema’s theory and its derived models by Zhang et al. The name of the software comes from the name of the famous scientist Andries Miedema. In memory of his great contribution to the empirical thermodynamical model of “Cohesion in metals”, we name this software as “Miedema Calculator”.
